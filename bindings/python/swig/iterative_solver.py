    The base class for all iterative optimizers.

    This class is the base class for iterative optimizers. No derivatives
    of any order appear in the class implementation because not all
    optimization problem solvers require derivatives.

    An iterative solver, during the process of minimizing a cost function,
    moves from one point to the next in the parameter space. After
    computing a step, some optimization algorithms use some criteria to
    decide whether or not to take the step and to move to the next point.
    In the context of the class hierarchy rooted at this class, a step
    that is taken is called an accepted step, and a step that is not taken
    is called a rejected step. All the classes of the hierarchy that
    implement the solve() method must correctly record all the points and
    their associated cost function values after taking accepted steps
    only. The initial starting point and its cost value must also be
    recorded.

    This class is not associated with any problem (from the problem class
    hierarchy). Problems may appear in different formats (even if
    equivalent): residual/Jacobian, cost-function/gradient, cost-function
    only ...
