! Correction to be applied to the index of refraction and to the extinction 
! coefficients of the pure water to obtain the ocean water one (see for 
! example Friedman). By default, a typical sea water is assumed 
! (Salinity=34.3ppt, Chlorinity=19ppt) as reported by Sverdrup. 
! In that case there is no correction for the extinction coefficient between 
! 0.25 and 4 microns. For the index of refraction, a correction of +0.006 
! has to be applied (McLellan). For a chlorinity of 19.0ppt the correction 
! is a linear function of the salt concentration. Then, in 6S users are able 
! to enter the salt concentration (in ppt).
